**Summery**
This app allows a user to create an account and log in with either thier own credentials or with Google login. Once they access their secure dashboard, a user can create, save, and print level 1 characters using Paizo's Pathfinder Gaming system under the Open Game License (OGL).

The internal API has a number of endpoints that simply return the various data collections that the app needs; from lists of classes available to the player to the gear choices. In addition, the API also is responsible for User registration, verification, and authentication using Passport and JWTs

**Tech**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
